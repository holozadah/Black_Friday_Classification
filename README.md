# Black_Friday_Classification
Black Friday is the most popular day for Americans. They are more willing to do shopping and buy more items than any usual days. This study is to classify the purchasers' gender based on their Age range, City located, Occupation, Marital status, and purchase. I used different prediction models such as KNN, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. The outcome prediction has been analyzed by a confusion matrix. Also, Accuracy along with a recall, precision, and F-score have been measured.
